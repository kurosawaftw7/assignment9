SEO Knowledge Gained:

	In this introductory lesson, I learned my first tidbits of information about SEO, including general definitions of SEO and important but basic concepts involving the importance of SEO. The slides also introduced me to some basic code to integrate my websites with other well known social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter (X). 
	To best make use of SEO concepts, we were told about Google Analytics and HeatMap, both of which aid the web designer in getting more traffic to their site as well as optimizing sites themselves to be more enticing and efficient for the end-user. I’m glad the video instructor alerted us to the fact that most free options for info-finding are just as good as the paid options, saving us money.

How I’d Implement SEO:
	
	In my websites going forward, I’d implement the methods described in the assigned materials and possibly even material that is self-researched to allow web searches to better find and recommend my website to users. Facebook and Twitter links are described in the assignment 10 PowerPoint slides, and I believe this would be the easiest way to start implementing SEO. 
	Then, I can learn and implement social tags and creative uses of header tags and language to increase site traffic and user engagement. This applies to using SEO to have my sites appear on search engine results and get better hits on these engines, but also I’d very much like my sites to have higher and longer engagement times with people who visit these sites, regardless of where they came from or how they found my sites.
